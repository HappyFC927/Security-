# Security+ Study Guide

## Chapter 1: General Security Concepts
### Core Map:
- **CIA Triad**
  - **Confidentiality** - Encryption (e.g., AES, RSA)
  - **Access Controls** - RBAC, DAC
  - **Integrity** - Hashing (e.g., SHA-256, MD5)
  - **Digital Signatures**
  - **Availability** - Redundancy (e.g., RAID, backups)
  - **Disaster Recovery Plans**

- **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)**
  - **Authentication** - Passwords, Biometrics, Tokens
  - **Authorization** - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - **Accounting** - Logging and Monitoring

- **Defense in Depth**
  - Administrative Controls
  - Technical Controls
  - Physical Controls

## Chapter 2: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations
### Core Map:

  - **Network Attacks** - Man-in-the-Middle, DDoS

- **Vulnerabilities**
  - Misconfigurations
  - Unpatched Systems
  - Weak Passwords

- **Mitigation Techniques**
  - Patching and Updates

  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

## Chapter 3: Security Architecture and Design
### Core Map:
- **Secure Network Design**
  - **Segmentation** - VLANs, DMZs
  - **Firewalls** - Stateful, Stateless

- **Access Control Models**
  - Role-Based (RBAC)
  - Mandatory (MAC)
  - Discretionary (DAC)

- **Cloud Security**
  - Shared Responsibility Model
  - Encryption in Transit and at Rest

- **Zero Trust**

  - Least Privilege

## Chapter 4: Security Operations
### Core Map:
- **Incident Response Lifecycle**
  - Preparation
  - Detection and Analysis
  - Containment, Eradication, Recovery
  - Post-Incident Review

- **Monitoring Tools**
  - SIEM (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack)
  - Log Analysis

- **Forensics**
  - Evidence Collection
  - Chain of Custody

- **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity**
  - Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
  - Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

## Chapter 5: Governance, Risk, and Compliance
### Core Map:
- **Risk Management**
  - **Risk Assessment** - Qualitative, Quantitative
  - **Risk Mitigation** - Avoidance, Acceptance, Transfer

- **Compliance Standards**
  - GDPR
  - HIPAA
  - PCI-DSS

- **Policies and Procedures**
  - Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
  - Incident Response Policy

- **Third-Party Risk Management**
  - Vendor Assessments
  - Supply Chain Security

## How to Practice with These Maps:
- Recreate the Maps from Memory:
Start with a blank sheet and try to recreate the map for a specific chapter. This will help you identify gaps in your understanding.
- Expand the Maps:
Add examples, tools, or real-world scenarios to each node. For instance, under "Malware," you could add "WannaCry" as an example of ransomware.
- Quiz Yourself:
Cover parts of the map and try to recall the missing details. For example, hide the "CIA Triad" subcategories and try to list them from memory.
- Link Concepts Across Maps:
Draw connections between chapters. For example, link "Incident Response" (Chapter 4) with "Risk Mitigation" (Chapter 5) to see how they interact.
