# Real-World Applications of Cybersecurity Principles

## **Confidentiality - Encryption**
- **Banking & Financial Transactions:** Banks use AES encryption to protect customer data and secure online transactions.
- **Messaging Apps (End-to-End Encryption):** Platforms like Signal and WhatsApp use RSA and AES encryption to keep conversations private.
- **VPNs:** Organizations use VPNs to encrypt employee communications and protect data from interception.

## **Access Controls - RBAC, DAC**
- **Corporate Networks:** Companies enforce RBAC in Active Directory to restrict employee access to sensitive files based on their job roles.
- **Cloud Services:** AWS IAM policies control access to services and resources, preventing unauthorized actions.
- **Healthcare Systems (HIPAA Compliance):** DAC is used in medical databases where doctors have discretion over patient record access.

## **Integrity - Hashing**
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Security tools like Tripwire or OSSEC check file hashes to detect unauthorized modifications.
- **Blockchain Transactions:** Cryptocurrencies use SHA-256 hashing to ensure tamper-proof financial records.
- **Password Storage:** Websites store hashed passwords using bcrypt or PBKDF2 to prevent plaintext exposure.

## **Digital Signatures**
- **Software Distribution:** Microsoft signs updates with digital signatures to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Email Security (DKIM):** Email servers use digital signatures to verify message authenticity and prevent spoofing.
- **Legal Documents:** Digital signatures are used in contracts to guarantee integrity and authenticity.

## **Availability - Redundancy**
- **Data Centers:** Companies use RAID and load balancing to ensure website uptime during peak traffic.
- **Cloud Backups:** Services like Google Drive and AWS S3 store redundant copies of user data across multiple locations.
- **Failover Mechanisms:** Hospitals implement redundant systems to keep life-critical medical equipment operational.

## **Disaster Recovery Plans**
- **Cyberattack Response:** Companies like Equifax implemented DR plans to recover from data breaches.
- **Natural Disaster Recovery:** Businesses in hurricane-prone areas set up off-site backups and emergency response protocols.
- **Government & Critical Infrastructure:** Power grids and emergency communication networks maintain redundant failover systems for national security.
